        <h2>About the class</h2>
        <p>As learning from previous front end classes, I hope I can learn more about efficiency and overall design
            process
            so I can quickly and more effectively make better websites. I'm also excited to learn about azure!
        </p>
        <h2>About myself</h2>
        <p>My name is Philip Le, I don't really go by anything else, and I don't mind other names also. At the moment,
            I'm in my 5th year and I'm doing Co-Terminal this semester including this class! When it comes to
            experience, I really only have last years web development class as experience so I'm not and expert by any
            means, but I'm still in an eager leaning phase!</p>
        <h3>Other things about me</h3>
        <p>I am currently an ITM Major with a specialization in Web Design.</p>
        <p>I'm apart of the Volleyball Club for a year now and would love if other people would join as well!</p>
        <p>In free time, I'm usually messing around with games, Photoshop, and Premier Pro (although I'm just an
            amateur).</p>
        <p>I'm a bit of a Tetris enthusiast.</p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I'm not too much of a person to talk about goals, but I wanted to layout to path for myself. Taking this
            class, I hope that I can learn skills and use it for a future job/intern, and as well as personal use. I
            imagine that I can definitely use this in many ways such as creating websites for myself like a portfolio,
            or making it for someone else. Apart from this class, I hope I can work on design projects with Photoshop
            and what not. </p>
